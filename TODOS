add security to parse for:
  events: read:*, write: admin
  event: read:*, write:admin
  userevent: read: user, admin, write: user
  userevent: create/change only for/by user for themself
  eventcomment: read: *, write: user themself, mods
  (basically, just write permissions into acl field whenever creating a row, i think...so, for events, tell adam, for new users/comments/userevents, code it to do so)

  parse users, user list, num users, user emails, other attributes... data made private? (probably just go with user only read/write on user table, and duplicate username in comments table)

....check more on paper

do with adam:
fix facebook/email links
deploy!
clear data store and add real events
email current mail list with event and signup info

do maybe, or after:
login with fb
photos
notifications
do something with past events
ajax save spinners
loading/route spinners

do after:
...cordova/app store
check event sorting


NOTES
show comment box before login
think more about sorting on events page
add contact page
split events into iheartjew vs other community
have links on left for different event sections
