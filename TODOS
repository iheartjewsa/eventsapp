add security to parse for:
  events: read:*, write: admin
  event: read:*, write:admin
  userevent: read: user, admin, write: user
  userevent: create/change only for/by user for themself
  eventcomment: read: *, write: user themself, mods
  (basically, just write permissions into acl field whenever creating a row, i think...so, for events, tell adam, for new users/comments/userevents, code it to do so)

  table-level permissions for all tables
  remove App Permissions - Allow client class creation 
  
  parse users, user list, num users, user emails, other attributes... data made private? (probably just go with user only read/write on user table, and duplicate username in comments table)
