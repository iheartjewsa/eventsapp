add security to parse for:
  DONE TABLE LEVEL: events: read:*, write: admin
  DONE TABLE LEVEL: event: read:*, write:admin
  DONE userevent: read: all, admin, write: user
  DONE userevent: create/change only for/by user for themself
  DONE eventcomment: read: *, write: user themself, mods

  parse users, user list, num users, user emails, other attributes... data made private? (probably just go with user only read/write on user table, and duplicate username in comments table...hacker can still see number of users via get all user_events and then dedupe)

....check more on paper

comment sorting
photos
notifications
